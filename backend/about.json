    "bio":"I am a software engineer who is a natural builder- from laying block as a structural engineer to writing blocks of code as a developer. I bring a strong work ethic skilled in using empathetic communication, critical thinking skills, and a knack for problem-solving with groups of people to any team. I believe these are all vital to cross-team success to create efficient solutions for clients."
